# Software Development Guide

This is a guide to software development at Medical Data Works.
It both serves as a source of information for how we work at MDW, and as a basis for discussions and reaching consensus on this topic.

**Read The Turing Way instead**

If you are looking for an overall picture of best practices, read
[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) first.
Because The Turing Way is language agnostic, this guide mostly provides
addtional specific
[language guides](best_practices/language_guides/languages_overview.md).

If you would like to contribute to this book see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
