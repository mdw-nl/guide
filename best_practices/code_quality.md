# Code Quality

Ways to improve code quality are in the [Code quality](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/code-quality.html) chapter on the Turing Way.

There are [online software quality improvement tools](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/code-quality/code-quality-style.html#online-services-providing-software-quality-checks) see the [language guides](language_guides/languages_overview.md) for good options per language.


## Name spaces

If your language supports namespaces, use **nl.medicaldataworks[.<projectname>**. If the project is an open-source library in a different organization, use the specific project or (GitHub) organization namespace.

## Code reviews

See the [Code Reviews](code_review.md) section.
